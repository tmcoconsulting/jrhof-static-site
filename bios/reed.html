    <p><strong>Terry Reed has called thousands of games across decades — but his greatest victories came off the field.</strong></p>

    <p>Terry's umpiring career spans more than 40 years, with an impressive résumé that includes numerous district, regional, and state tournaments, plus multiple state championships in both baseball and softball. He has earned a reputation as a trusted and respected figure in the Colorado officiating community, and his love for the game has led to countless friendships over the years.</p>

    <p>His accolades extend beyond Colorado. Terry was invited to umpire at the 2018 Dreams Park Tournament in Cooperstown, NY — a career highlight that also gave him the opportunity to visit the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He has also received bronze, silver, and gold medals from ASA/USA Softball, along with National Indicator Fraternity honors and multiple Umpire of the Year awards.</p>

    <p>A Kansas native, Terry moved to Colorado in 1976. He and his wife Penny — married since 1977 — have three daughters and six grandchildren. Originally a men's fast pitch and slow pitch player, Terry eventually transitioned to officiating, becoming a 3-sport official in baseball, softball, and basketball with CHSAA. He also served two terms as an area director on the softball side.</p>

    <p><strong>In 2023, Terry faced his most difficult opponent yet: cancer.</strong> After enduring severe abdominal pain, doctors discovered a tumor in his hip and pelvis. Diagnosed as bone cancer originating from his kidney, Terry stepped away from officiating — believing he had only a few months left to live. CHSAA honored him with the ceremonial first pitch at the 5A state championship, surrounded by family and fellow officials.</p>

    <p>But as Yogi Berra once said, <em>“It ain’t over ‘til it’s over.”</em> Thanks to an experimental surgery and a strong will to fight, Terry made a miraculous recovery. By mid-2023, he was walking — even jogging — and by 2024, he was back on the field umpiring games again. His cancer is now in remission, and he continues monthly treatments to keep it away.</p>

    <p>Terry sees his survival and return to officiating as part of a divine plan. He credits God, his family, and the support of the officiating community for giving him the strength to keep going. With a few more pitches to call and plenty of wisdom to share, Terry Reed’s story is far from finished.</p>
